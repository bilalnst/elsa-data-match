# HeyElsa Data Match

Card-matching puzzle that teaches Elsa’s ethical data playbook:

- 6 data ↔ decision pairs; every match updates the insight copy and avatar.
- Badge tiers calculated from moves vs. time (`Data Rookie` → `Data Guardian`).
- All artwork lives in `assets/`; add more cards by extending the `cardPairs` array in `elsa.js`.

## How to Run

```bash
# jump into the project
cd elsa-data-match
